Prophetic Depository Charter
The First Global Archive for Prophetic Writings, Teachings, and Testimonies

Overview

This repository is the official Prophetic Depository of Covered by Chukwu Ministries™.
It serves as the first global archive for preserving prophetic writings, teachings, and testimonies in a transparent and verifiable way.

Every entry will be dated and published.

All records will stand as historical, theological, and prophetic evidence of God’s voice in this generation.

The depository exists as both a witness (legal and spiritual proof) and a resource (study material for the global Church, scholars, and future generations).

Purpose

“Write the vision; make it plain on tablets, so he may run who reads it.” – Habakkuk 2:2

This archive documents:

Prophetic declarations and words

Doctrinal teachings and exegetical notes

Testimonies of visions, dreams, and encounters

Prophetic exegesis of Scripture

Historical fulfillment records

Our mandate is to reclaim, protect, and publish what belongs to God.
